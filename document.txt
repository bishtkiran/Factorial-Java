//Calculating Factorial of a given number
//Tried to use IntelliJ shortcuts.

TDD Approach
1. Written the test-cases first and then written code to pass the test cases.
2. had to write minimal code.
3. Coverage is maximum


// Results should be like this
0! = 1
1! = 1
2! = 2 * 1 = 2
3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6
4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24
5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
